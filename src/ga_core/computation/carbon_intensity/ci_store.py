# This file defines an abstract base class (ABC) for CI data storage backends.
# Implement this interface to add a new storage backend (e.g. database, file).

# NOTE: This abstract class is defined here since it acts as an interface between the ga_core package and GA Dashboard,

    """
    This is an abstract base class (ABC) that defines a common interface for saving and fetching CI data from backend storage.
    CI data can be stored to avoid repeated API calls and processing of CI data for dates that are already processed.
 
    ga_core depends only on this interface — it has no knowledge of how or where data is stored. 
Implementations of this class (for different CI sources) are directly included in the tools that call them (e.g. in the Green Algorithms Dashboard repository), inheriting from `CIStorageBackend`.
